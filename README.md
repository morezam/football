# Football Results

An app for seeing football results. I used [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) for its api. Users can click on each match and see the corresponding data to that match like events, lineups, statistics, and the result of previous matches between the two.

It does not show all leagues. Only popular leagues and Iran league.
